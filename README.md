rfaThumbnailCreator
===================

### Create PNG files from your Revit Family libraries.

Do you have a large libaray of RFA files in your organization or maybe a big repository you have downloaded from a manufacturer with weird naming conventions?

Do you wish you have a quick slide deck or similar that you could thumb through to see what the families somewhat look like before opening each one individually to find that is not the on you are looking for? Or to just judge the accuracy of a family to see if you should just re-create it yourself?

Would you like a utility that scans your repository and creates thumbnail images of each RFA file with the same name so you can do all the above?

I am lazy like you too, so I wrote this quick and dirty little utility that takes a directory (and subdirectories) of RFA families and creates thumbnails of each so I can visually scan through to see what I like and don't like or if I need something that has a crazy name.
